### Explanation:

- **Annotations**: Use `@Handler` to mark classes that should be recognized as handlers.
- **Mediator**: The core of the pattern, managing the registration and execution of handlers.
- **Handlers & Requests**: Separate classes for commands, queries, and their respective handlers.
- **Code Generation**: Automates the discovery and registration of handlers using `build_runner` and `source_gen`.
- **Test**: Ensures that the mediator works as expected.
- **Example**: Demonstrates usage of the package.
